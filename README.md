### What's this?
This is a Spring sample app for a MongoDB-based backend, with JWT role-based authentication and real-time notifications through Server Sent Events. The sample project consists in a well documented shift management web app (in Eclipse, right click on the project and select "Generate Javadoc" to browse the docs as a website).
This sample project includes a Dockerfile to automate the creation of Docker images at build time through [Spotify's Dockerfile Maven](https://github.com/spotify/dockerfile-maven).
I'm developing this project to have a working POC for Spring's latest features, feel free to take from it.

### Setup
Just import in Eclipse as 'Existing Maven Project'. You need a running MongoDB instance/cluster for this project to function: 
* To try out the project substitute DB config and credentials in `application.properties` and run the project. 
* For user facing setups configuration and credentials should be passed through environment variables injected at runtime `(in application.properties you can find a sample of Spring's injection syntax for properties -> "${ENV_VARIABLE_NAME:default-value-if-env-variable-not-found}")`
* To run on Docker, build with Maven with goals='clean package' and `docker run --env MONGODB_USERNAME=yourusername --env MONGODB_PASSWORD=yourpassword --env MONGODB_HOST_NAMES=host.docker.internal:27017 -p 8080:8080 -p 27017:27017 sashacorp/spring-mongo-jwt-api:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT`
